       "\n",
       "1. **Eco-Transit Revolution**:\n",
       "   - **Eco-Metro**: Ecodora has invested in a modern metro system called the \"Eco-Metro,\" which includes the construction of 5 new metro lines serving over 2 million passengers daily. This initiative significantly reduces the reliance on cars and helps lower carbon emissions.\n",
       "   - **E-Ride**: The city introduced 300 electric buses branded as \"E-Ride,\" which have contributed to a 20% reduction in carbon emissions.\n",
       "   - **Wheel Share**: Ecodora has established over 700 bike-sharing stations with 15,000 bicycles available for rent, promoting cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Ecodora Oasis Initiative**:\n",
       "   - **Central Eco Haven**: A 75-acre central park featuring hiking trails, playgrounds, and a serene lake, providing a green space for recreation and relaxation.\n",
       "   - **Green Canopy Gardens**: More than 150 buildings in Ecodora showcase green roofs, totaling 75 acres of rooftop greenery, which help enhance air quality and foster biodiversity.\n",
       "   - **Neighborhood Gardens**: The city has created 30 neighborhood gardens, offering gardening plots for residents and promoting community engagement in green activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Ecodora, the Energy Champion**:\n",
       "   - **Eco-Harmony 3.0**: New building codes mandate the use of energy-efficient appliances and enhanced thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption.\n",
       "   - **Retrofit Renaissance**: Over 500 existing buildings have undergone energy-saving renovations, improving their energy efficiency.\n",
       "   - **Solar Splendor**: Solar panels have been installed on more than 1,500 government buildings, harnessing renewable energy and reducing the city's carbon footprint.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Eco-Living Paradise**:\n",
       "   - **Recycle with Care**: Over 85% of households actively engage in Ecodora's recycling program, significantly reducing waste.\n",
       "   - **Composting Crusaders**: The city has placed 400 community composting bins throughout neighborhoods, encouraging residents to compost organic waste.\n",
       "   - **Waste-to-Biogas Facility**: An innovative plant that transforms organic waste into renewable energy, contributing to a circular economy.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Ecodoran Civic Engagement**:\n",
       "   - **Ecodora Community Forums**: Regular public meetings held in each district to gather citizen input and involve residents in decision-making processes.\n",
